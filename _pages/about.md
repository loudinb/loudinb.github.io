I have 20+ years of experience solving problems computationally. From complex physics problems to complex data problems.  I explore algorithms, construct mathematical models, develop quantitative methodologies, and use computers to analyze and solve real-life business problems on a daily basis.  My computational experience spans the use of high performance computing systems with petaflops of processing power, to large scale distributed data processing platforms capable of analyzing petabytes of daily data.

I recieved an MS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Cincinnati.  My area of study was control theory with practical studies in active noise control of submarines to reduce the sonar signature (BBN Technologies) and attitude and orbit control system of spacecrafts (NASA, John F. Kennedy Space Center).
